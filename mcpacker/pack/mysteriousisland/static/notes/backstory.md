October 20th, 1897

It's been a long voyage, but a pleasant one.  Having left Sydney on an east-bound steamer two weeks
ago, I expect we shall arrive in Chile in about another week's time.  The book Mr. Phelps lent me on
hydraulic engineering is fascinating, and helps pass the time as we cross the South Pacific.  Just
open ocean in all directions for days now.


October 22nd, 1897

We've had high seas these past four-and-twenty hours, which has been extremely disruptive to
everyone on board.  I was hoping to adapt my plans for an industrial-scale excavator to include what
I've been learning on hydraulics, but it's impossible to keep the ink-pots from overturning.  Alas,
the same has to be said for the contents of my stomach.  This is the first time the ship has been
steady enough to even update my journal.  It brings my grandmother's herb-lore to mind... if only
there were a source of fresh *Athelas* in the depths of the Pacific!


October 23rd, 1897

I got to tour the engine-room today!  It was fascinating to see such a large engine at work.  The
designs I've been creating for steam locomotives are far smaller.  The amount of coal those
behemoths consume is beyond belief!


October 26th?, 1897

I don't know who might ever read this journal now, but I want to keep track of my own impressions
for as long as I last.  Things were going exceedingly well when I last wrote, but calamity has
overtaken us since then.  So far as I can tell, I'm the sole survivor of the H.M.S. Britannia, and
I've been marooned on an island (continent?) after our steamer was caught in a monstrous typhoon.
If I survive, I may record that tale, but I must conserve my ink and notebook as they are virtually
the only things I have left in my possessionâ€”not even shoes!

I am profoundly blessed by the Creator to have lived outside Sherwood for most of my life with a
grandmother steeped in botanical knowledge.  Little did I realize those pleasant walks at her side
might now mean the difference between life and death.  My first priorities must be water, food, and
then shelter.  I don't recall how long ago that bubble-and-squeak on the Promenade Deck was, but the
hollow feeling gnawing at me indicates that it's been longer than I like.
