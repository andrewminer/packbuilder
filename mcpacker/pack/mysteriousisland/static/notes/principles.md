# Summary

Mysterious Island is a modpack for Minecraft v1.20.1 built around the premiss of a Victorian-era
enigneer finding himself marooned in the South Pacific.  His mechanical skills, and a bit of botany
learned at his grandmother's knee is all that stands between him and his own mortality.

As he explores the countryside, he discovers the odd trace of long-abandoned industrial civilization
but no signs of any current inhabitants.  Formerly domesticated flora and fauna  have been left
feral long enough to have started to migrate back toward their ancestral forms and habitats.  The
only dangers appear to be natural ones: starvation, predatory animals, exposure, and the odd
shipwreck containing dangerous pirates!


# Alterations from Vanilla Minecraft

There are many game systems which are tuned to be more challenging survival game.  In particular:

* Natural healing is greatly diminished (~ 2 hearts healed per in-game day with adequate food).
* Hunger reduces even when the player is standing still.  This effect isenough to deplete a full
    hunger bar during the course of a single in-game day.
* Stack sizes for items are greatly reduced, and are mostly proportionate to the density of the
    objects being carried,.
* Some surfaces are much more difficult to traverse (e.g., sand), causing a slow-down effect similar
    to soul sand in vanilla.
* The player has a thirst meter which functions much like the hunger meter.
* Water found in the world contains contaminants and pathogens which need to be removed by boiling
* Only water from rivers and oceans automatically recreates water source blocks
* The player is vulnerable to both hot and cold weather, and it will be necessary to prepare
    yourself with gear suitable to such environments.

There are also a few things which have gotten a bit easier:

* No undead mobs, Pillagers, etc.
* Grass pathways give the player a little speed boost, and paved roads an even bigger one.
* It's possible to make pathways on most soft surfaces (dirt, sand, gravel, etc.).
* All crops spawn naturally in the wild, but only in biomes where that plant naturally grows.
* Lots of additional food items and recipes are available.


# Finding Resources

This modpack has a strong focus on exploration, and, to that end, you'll find that resources only
spawn in areas where they naturally would in the real world, and in ways you'd normally find them.
So, coal is found both as anthricite deep underground, and as peat in boggy areas.  Deposits are
also spread out across the various biomes of the world, requiring that you explore extensively to
find everything you might want.

Similarly, plants and animals only appear in biomes where they appear in nature. Potatoes are a
boreal, highland crop, while corn is an arid, subtropical one.  You'll find the same is true for all
the other plants and animals in the modpack.


# Technology

The modpack is set in the real world in the year 1897, so you can expect to find Victorian-era
technology available.  No magic, potions, etc. from fantasy settings.
